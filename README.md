# General Information
--
This repo is used to show the process to develop functions for OpenFOAM and how these functions need to be structured to archive working applications to enchance your CFD simulations.


## Basics


## First example 
The first example (00_monod_simple) is used to show how the basic monod calculation with fix values for muemax and an inital cell density can be applied and calculated using C++.
