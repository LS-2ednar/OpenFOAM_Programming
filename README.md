### General Information
---  
This repo is used to show the process to develop functions for OpenFOAM and how these functions need to be structured to archive working applications to enchance your CFD simulations.

### Basics


### First example 
The first example (**00_monod_simple**) is used to show how the basic monod calculation with fix values for muemax and an inital cell density can be applied and calculated using C++.
